==============
 INSTALLATION
============== 

1) Install MinUI itself the standard way, per the instructions in its readme.

2) Copy the Emus, Roms, and Tools folders from this release and paste them onto the root of your SD card, merging them with the folders you already have. Allow them to overwrite files if prompted.

3) Add your own copies of pico8_dyn and pico8.dat from the most recent Raspberry Pi version of Pico-8 to the Tools/rg35xxplus/Splore.pak/pico8/ folder or the Tools/rg40xxcube/Splore.pak/pico8/ folder, depending on your preference. If you plan to use your SD card across multiple devices, you do not need to add the files to both locations. For the RGB30, you will need pico8_64 instead of or in addition to pico8_dyn.

4) In the Tools/rg35xxplus/Wi-Fi.pak/, Tools/rg40xxcube/Wi-Fi.pak/, and Tools/rgb30/Wi-Fi.pak/ folders, there is a wifi.txt. On the first line, add the SSID (name of your wifi network). On the second line, add the PSK (password of that network). Do this for each of the devices you wish to connect to your network - unlike the Splore paks, these are platform specific, so you must make sure to add your network in this way to each of the three platforms you wish to connect to the internet.

5) Add any Pico-8 carts you wish to play offline to the Roms/Pico-8 (P8-NATIVE) folder.


=======
 USAGE
=======

If you wish to use Splore to browse and play free Pico-8 games directly over the internet, make sure to connect beforehand by either logging into your network in the stock OS before installing MinUI, or by running the Wi-Fi tool inside MinUI after following the instructions in 4) above.

Games you have added to Roms/Pico-8 (P8-NATIVE) will open in native Pico-8 when launched from MinUI. Splore itself can be launched from the Tools menu in MinUI.

To exit Pico-8 at any time, simply tap the power button to close it and return to MinUI.

If you have trouble getting the Wi-Fi.pak to work properly:
1. Go to Tools/Reboot into Stock.
2. Go to Settings/Network Settings/WIFI Settings and login to your network.
3. Go to App Center/AAPS/TF2 (or TF1 if your not using the recommended 2 card setup).
4. Select REBOOT-INTO-MINUI.
5. If the WiFi icon does not show up in MinUI repeat steps 1-4.
